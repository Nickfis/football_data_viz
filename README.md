# football_data_viz

This was a final (small) project for the data visualization course during my Masters' degree at BGSE. 
This was the first time I worked in Shiny, trying to depict different playing styles through the use of interactive heatmaps.
The app can be viewed through the following link:

All the code is in the repository.
